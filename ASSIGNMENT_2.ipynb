    "# <b>Text Analysis of Kratom Product Exposures in FDA's FAERS Database</b>\n",
    "<b>SUMMARY</b>\n",
    "Analyze the all-time reports of patient- or provider-submitted exposures to kratom products, including synthetic dervatives, for my capstone investigation. Looking at the specific details of each case report will help me understand how kratom cases are reported to the FDA and what the most common outcomes are. These cases are only related to kratom, not its isolate products 7-oh or mitragynine pseudoindoxyl. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>NOTE:</b> FDA's FAERS database is not mandatory and thus is not comprehensive of all kratom exposures. In lieu of poison control data, which I have requested from the National Poison Centers, these case reports will serve as a substitute analysis. These are the cases that are transformed into full published case studies, so can give me a good understanding of the clinical reports used to make regulatory decisions.\n",

    "## <b> Methodology </b>\n",
    "1. Download the most-recent case reports of the three kratom product categories: \"Herbals/mitragynine\", \"7-hydroxymitragynine\", \"mitragynine pseudoindoxyl\".\n",
    "2. Export the .csv file into a .txt file for analysis of keywords, trends, and other details. Because the dataset is qualitative in nature and is non-comprehensive, a text analysis instead of a pandas data aggregation/summary is the best process for analysis.\n",
    "3. Pull out the summary information for the following data in each report:\n",
    "- The number of serious vs non-serious cases\n",
    "- The counts for each year (beginning in 2015)\n",
    "- The top 5 most common products/drugs/supplements used concomitantly with kratom products\n",
    "- The most common reason for use\n",
    "- The most common reactions\n",
    "- Demographic summaries (most common patient age, location, etc.)\n",
    "- What Reference Literature is most commonly used for each case (where applicable)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What I'll need for each piece of the analysis:\n",
    "- The number of serious vs non-serious cases\n",
    "    - Regex to keyword search, maybe uppercase/fuzzy matching\n",
    "- The counts for each year (beginning in 2015)\n",
    "    - regex to locate date strings, extracting first four digits of year, pandas.groupby to count per year\n",
    "- The top 5 most common products/drugs/supplements used concomitantly with kratom products\n",
    "    - Regex, spaCy's named entity recognition for drug name capturing, fuzzy matching\n",
    "- The most common reason for use\n",
    "    - regex, custom functions, pandas counters\n",
    "- The most common reactions\n",
    "    - Regex (for lists), counters\n",
    "- Demographic summaries (most common patient age, location, etc.)\n",
    "    - Regex for ages and lines starting with \"Sex\", spaCy for extracting locations (?maybe?)\n",
    "- What Reference Literature is most commonly used for each case (where applicable)\n",
    "    - Regex for \"reference\" sections.\n",
